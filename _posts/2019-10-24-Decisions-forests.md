## Abstract
Climate change will change the forests we have known forever. We might never see the BC old growth forest again as it was 20 years ago. But it is very difficult to understand the idea that the all-powerful conditions of the planet will transform in a way we cannot predict. What we can do is reflecting about how we steward the land with a long term vision.

## Introduction

One of the greatest sustainability challenges for the forest ecosystems nowadays is predicting if the trees growing in a certain landscape will survive and be healthy while climate, one of their determinant life factors, is undergoing dramatic change.
The Forestry in BC course students made three trips with the objective of understanding the conditions of the forests in the region. On the first trip to Lillooet we visited a restoration project where one of the main activities was replanting a species that has almost disappeared from the forest. During our second trip to Vancouver Island, a tour in a silvicultural plantation showed us how the owner company is planting only one specie in most of their plots. Along the third trip to the Malcom Knapp Research Forest (MKRF) we witnessed on one hand, sites replanted with seedlings of 6 different species and on the other hand, an area where the ambition of transforming the forestry activity into an automated activity led to new machines, technology and planting procedures for establishing monocultures that are nowadays obsolete.	
Given these four experiences from the trip, an important dilemma arises from the different underlying logics and opposing principles we observed in practices of restoring the landscape; shall we opt for high economical value and wide ecological range of the species we are planting after harvesting forests or should we better value the diversity although many of those species are not very resistant or are not doing very well today?
One of the main concerns of today’s ecologists is how ecosystems are going to adapt to the phenomenon of climate change. Ecosystems have always adapted to different changes in physicochemical factors, even under drastic changes in recent glacier ages (Lezine et. al. 2019) but the anthropogenic change of our current era is not only happening at a very high speed but also accelerating (IPCC 2007).
In the forest landscapes of BC, trees and more generally plant individuals are a very important share of the individuals that compose the native ecosystems, and every plant is known for having a habitat determined in a large extent by a climate (that normally determines temperatures, soil types, precipitation, and other biophysical factors) that the individuals of a certain specie need for succeeding in growing and reproducing (May & McLean, 2007). With climate change, the location of these life zones is displacing (Lenoir et. al, 2008) and probably, a good number of plant individuals are nowadays living in a place that, in the future, will end up having different climate conditions that do not belong to their habitat, and therefore, where they and their progeny would be unable to survive.
Some live beings, like bats, have the ability of migrating quickly in response to the change of their habitat, travelling even thousands of kilometers in a season to find suitable conditions (Milner-Gulland et al 2011), but one of the great questions that arises from the issue of climate change adaptation is whether the plant populations will be able to move quickly enough to get to keep up with the “shift” of their habitats (Corlett & Westcott, 2013).

## Main Discussion

How shall foresters, who work with plants and profit from their successful growth, deal with this new degree of complexity in their work? Two directions or paths (there are certainly more) we can look at to inform our decisions into the future is; under which climates will a plant have to survive if it wants to complete its life cycle, and complementarily, if the plant will have a successful growth under those conditions?
One straightforward approach to gain certainty on whether a plant will grow inside its life range throughout her life cycle is to consult the climate scenarios that are being made for the local regions as reported in Hamann & Wang (2006). A key aspect of these scenarios is that their occurrence is probabilistic, and one should decide for one or another with a considerable risk of the climate evolving into another trajectory.
On top of that, in regions with irregular topography, another factor that should be taken into consideration are the variations of the terrain, that on a microscale can be determinant according to Corlett and Westcott (2013). For example, even at the same altitude, facing north or south side of a slope can imply an important difference of radiation and wind, making planning more complicated and fragmented. 
Climate scenarios and topography are, in a sense, slightly predictable, however, there are many other “complex consequences” that might derive from the climate zones shift: how do we know how a certain type of soil is going to react with another climate? What will happen to evapotranspiration and rain regimes in that micro area once the stable pattern is modified? Are the plants we are planting stronger than some other plants that will tend to establish in the area once the climate zone is modified?
Naturally, as a response to this component of the problem, some different approaches have been evaluated in British Columbia reported by Hagerman and Chan (2009): new or dynamic reserves that adapt to climate zones and assisted colonization. The idea of assisted colonization, which consists in helping species that thrive in certain climate zone to populate an area that is not yet but will be in that climate zone in the future can be informative. According to Sork, Aitken et. al. (2013), the individuals planted in this process can also be enhanced by genetic selection, cross breeding and other biological methods to adapt better to uncertain conditions. 
An important factor to keep in mind while discussing these alternatives is that most of the species we know (or could create in a future) have not been tested to grow with changing climatic conditions throughout their life. This factor is a two-edge sword, as it adds more uncertainty to the selection of the right species but, on the other hand, we could end up developing species that benefit from one climate on a first stage of their life and from another (namely, the incoming climatic zone) during a late stage. The process that would allow us to develop these kinds of species is clearly uncertain, complicated and moreover, the growth curve (how they increase their size through time) that these new species would undergo in their life would be completely unknown.
The “choosing species dilemma” can be applied to many cases in the globe. In forestry practices in the Mexican region of the Yucatan Peninsula, for example, considering future habitat modification is not common. There, replanting after forest harvest is mandatory by the National Forest Ministry (CONAFOR). However, one of the most frequently planted trees reported by Wightman et. al. (2005) is a precious wood and highly valuable specie: Mahogany (Swetenia Macropylla). However, it is known in the local science that this tree can be sensitive to high temperatures and fire according to CONABIO (2019), conditions for sure forecasted in the climate change scenarios of the region projected by Orellana et al (2004) shall we plant trees that are sensitive to temperature alterations and that have narrow life ranges.

## Conclusion

The novel climate conditions we are encountering worldwide will transform the way forest practice and forest science are made. Sustainable Forest Management, the dominant paradigm in forestry, depends largely on the stability of stocks and the accounting we can do of them, so that we harvest always leaving enough for the future. Yet, without certainty on how old and healthy trees will be in the future, the mere basis of the paradigm cracks. Being mindful of these novel conditions and developing solutions to cope with uncertainty is a key aspect of professions dealing with ecosystems, which should be complemented with integral and interdisciplinary knowledge to take advantage of genetics, climate prediction, botany and many other areas of natural sciences that are doing important progress to build a bright future for the biosphere.
