# How much and in what do poor and rich spend on food in Mexico?

What do people buy when they have more money? I would argue that there’s a cultural factor in what “the rich” prioritize in different countries. A small experiment can be extracted from the National Survey on Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH 2018) in Mexico. If we calculate the quotient between the highest and lower income decile of a national sample of households, we learn that rich families spend in average 13.4K MXN and therefore 3 times more money in their food than the poorest families (4.5K), with some particular categories that are way more differentiated than others.

## Tortilla, the unifying and democratic food

Families in Mexico spend very similar amounts of money in tortillas, and interestingly enough, the richest and the poorest deciles are the ones that average the lowest trimestral expenditure, with nearly 700 pesos per trimester. All other households practically surpass 800 MXN per trimester, and where the middle income family lead with 850. Legumes (rich spend Δ23%, with the poor investing 430 MXN per trimester) sugar & honey (Δ29%, 365 MXN) and egg (Δ46%, 395 MXN) are other three categories in which there is not a very strong difference between rich and poor. 

## Restaurants, fish and fruit for the elite

Rich families in Mexico spend (11K MXN) almost 6 times more in restaurants and takeaway food than the poorest sector (1950 MXN) and twice as much as the second richest decile (6.5K). While rich families spend similar amounts in fish (1.9K) and fruit (2.4) the poorest spend one third of these figures averaging up (675 MXN) of fish and (425 MXN) of fruit every trimester. The difference of expenditure in alcohol is not extreme, with rich families drinking 2.5 times more value (3.2 K) than poor families (1.27 K) 

There is a drastic difference in the levels of expenditure in “out of the household” food, fish and fruit not only between the poorest and the richest, but even between the two richest deciles. The richest families (decile ten) spend twice as much in restaurants, 60% more in alcohol and 45% more in fish than the second richest decile.

This is just an overview of a interesting potential project: what do rich people use their money for? Why do we want more money and what are we really using it for? Does culture determine how people invest their money and is Mexico a particular pattern of differentiated expenditure in food?
