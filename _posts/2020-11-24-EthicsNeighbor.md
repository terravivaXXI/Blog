## [Letter to the Ethicist](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-ethicist)

Hello, my name is UC and would like to get some advice on how to deal with my neighbor.

I have 6 kids and for a very long time I have just been to the market and made food at home. I would love to use fancy appliances to cook faster (like a nespresso coffee maker) and go out to restaurants, like my neighbor DC, but that happens rarely.

Last week our city announced that the garbage collection service has collapsed, and the waste disposal services cannot take our garbage anymore. Landfills are full and they are looking for other ways of dealing with all the waste, but have not found any. The service is suspended until further notice.

My condo house stands out for having a large garden with diverse vegetated areas where my kids, moles and even mice play around. I do not take intensive care of it. As I cook at home and buy a few things, there’s lots of space to put garbage in my property while the service reestablishes. On the contrary, my neighbor DC used all his space some years ago by building a garage for storing the oversized gear and a parking ramp for his car, and the little space he had is already full of garbage bags.

To my surprise, DC, who lives alone, has been ordering takeout frequently and got a new microwave to reheat his food. A week ago, DC came over to ask if he could leave a big black garbage bag in my garden because he had no place to put it anymore and could see I had plenty of space. I was happy to agree in a helpful mood and he left his bag thanking me many times.

Yesterday, DC showed up in my door telling me that he had a plan submitted to the municipality so that “we” (he and me) could arrange all the garbage we were producing in all the available space we had. I asked for some time to read the plan and have not figured out how to respond to him. What should I do?
